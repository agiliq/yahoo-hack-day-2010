Hack created for Yahoo hack day, Bengaluru, 2010.

This is our experiment in totally open product development. We want to build a
product, with commercial viability, but with *everything* about it being open.

The product development has started at #opnhackday, but we will be working after this ends
to work on it as a commercial product.

At the minimum we want to keep the following things open.

* All the source code.
* Finacials.
* Other things of interest to Web Applications. (Signups, conversion funnel, conversion to paid members etc)
